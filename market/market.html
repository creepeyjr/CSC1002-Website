        <h2 class="market-header">Market & Customers</h2>
        <p class="market-text">Our product is aimed at beginners who are only getting started in the gym, elderly people who are trying to maintain mobility and strength and amateur gym goers who want personal training and feedback, but can't afford to hire a professional trainer.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="market-text">We went about identifying these people by creating a simple survey that interviewed a variety of people in the gym and found these people to be common outliers. They expressed frustration with their level and rate of progress in the gym, which helped us decide who our target market would be.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="market-text">The fitness tech industry is booming, with the global fitness app market projected to grow from $15 billion in 2022 to $34.4 billion by 2027. With increasing demand for AI-driven solutions, Form X is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth by offering an innovative, data-driven approach to fitness.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="market-text">We believe Form X is not just an app—it's a fitness companion, empowering users to train smarter, move better, and achieve their goals with confidence.</p>

    <h2 class="test-header">So why chose us?</h2>
    <p class="why-text">At Form X, we don’t just analyze your workouts—we revolutionize the way you train. Unlike KinesteX, which offers AI-driven form feedback, Form X goes a step further by integrating IoT body sensors, allowing us to track muscle fatigue and provide real-time injury alerts, ensuring safer, smarter training. While FitBod focuses on custom workout plans, it lacks real-time form corrections and injury prevention, two critical features that Form X delivers to keep you progressing without setbacks. And while Zone 7 caters mainly to elite athletes, we make cutting-edge AI-driven fitness accessible to everyone—beginners, intermediates, and professionals alike. No matter your experience level, Form X empowers you with expert guidance, personalized insights, and the confidence to train smarter, safer, and more effectively.</p>
